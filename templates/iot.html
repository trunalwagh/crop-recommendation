        <p class="card-text" >Internet of Things (IoT) is the networking of physical objects that contain electronics 
          embedded within their architecture in order to communicate and sense interactions 
          amongst each other or with respect to the external environment. In the upcoming years,
          IoT-based technology will offer advanced levels of services and practically change the 
          way people lead their daily lives. Advancements in medicine, power, gene therapies, 
          smart cities, and smart homes are just a very few of the categorical examples where 
          IoT is strongly established.
          Internet of Things (IoT) technology has brought revolution to each and every field of 
          common man’s life by making everything smart and intelligent. IoT refers to a network 
          of things which make a self-configuring network. The development of Intelligent 
          Smart Farming IoT based devices is day by day turning the face of agriculture 
          production by not only enhancing it but also making it cost-effective and reducing 
          wastage.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title my-4 text-light text-center" style="background-image: url('../static/images/ai.png')" >Artificial Intelligence</h5>
        
        <p class="card-text">Artificial Intelligence or AI which stands for intelligence refers to systems or machines 
          that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves 
          based on the information they collect. AI manifests in a number of forms.
          Artificial intelligence technology is supporting different sectors to boost productivity 
          and efficiency. AI solutions are assisting to overcome the traditional challenges in every 
          field. Likewise. AI in agriculture is helping farmers to improve their efficiency and 
          reduce environmental hostile impacts. The agriculture industry strongly and openly 
          embraced AI into their practice to change the overall outcome. AI is shifting the way 
          our food is produced where the agricultural sector’s emissions have decreased by 20%. 
          Adapting AI technology is helping to control and manage any uninvited natural 
          condition.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Machine learning is the branch of computer science which is used to construct 
          algorithms which exhibit self-learning property i.e., learning which is done by the 
          machine itself hence the term “Machine Learning”. It is considered to be one of the 
          major areas under Artificial Intelligence. For a machine to become intelligent like a 
          human mind, it has to first think and learn like a human. Human mind learns from past 
          data and experiences that it is exposed to and based on that it takes decisions in future.  </p>
